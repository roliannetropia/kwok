Thanks for downloading this pack of icons.  They are completely free for personal or commercial use, but they can not be resold individually or as a group.

These icons were originally created for the Invision Power File Manager system (http://www.invisionfilemanager.com/), so the naming convention follows that system.  (If using that system, simply drop these into the root "images" folder to over-write the default icons.) These icons can be easily dropped into any website, application or other file management system.

All icons are Copyright 2003 Kevin Potts.  For more information, or to request custom icon work, please contact Kevin at kevin@graphicpush.com.
